            <b> -Task 1 </b>
            <p><b> Massage A (Informal): </b>
                This massage is the informal one because it uses allot of informal words and it's written a bit like how we speak and not read, for example the text begins with saying “Whassup” which is a very unformal way to say hello and it isn't a real English word that we write down. Some other words that are informal in this text is “cash” and “AGES”. There are plenty words that are formal and means cash, instead of cash which is a more of a casual word but the way he wrote ages with all big letters are not very formal even though the word is formal (depending on how you use it). Because it applies that it's supposed to be pronounced in a different way. </p>
            <p><b> Massage B (formal): </b>
                This massage is very formal, it uses only formal words as I can see, and it is very formally structured. (NOT FINISHED) </p>

           <b> -Task 2 </b>
                <p> In recent years video games have become one of the most popular hobby but is it safe to be so connected to the digital world or is it better to have other hobbies that are more in the “real world” as some will say. This question seems to be very popular to ask and talk about and one of that reason is that video games is a lot of different things that is grouped together. And since video games have grown so much in so little time have made it so that people that are a bit older doesn't really understand a lot of it which makes it hard for them to talk about it and its’s influence on young people. </p>
 
                <p> Let's look at the positive with growing up with video games like many people have said that they learned English by playing games they really enjoy which is very hard for school or other teaching methods to do. And people have an easier time learning about how programs work because of the way they understand technology but in the end all of this depends on what they like to play and what they like to do with games. Some might only play the game in vanilla but other might want to add some modifications to the game and some just like to play with others and be more social. And all of this will make a difference on how games make a difference on the person but there do exist some extreme cases where video games have made some vast differences on people. But these differences aren't only because of video games but also mental health. </p>
 
                <p> Some of the extremal cases of what video games can lead to might be that they become very isolated because they only play alone and since it’s their hobby, they don’t socialize much. And it's also possible to get addicted to video games. Some games have a gambling system in their games can be very bad for children since it’s illegal for a child to gamble but it isn't so regulated with video games, and this can lead to gambling addictions. </p>
                <p> (A BIT RUSHED AT THE END) </p>
